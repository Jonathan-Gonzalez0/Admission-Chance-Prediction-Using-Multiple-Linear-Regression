# Admission-Chance-Prediction-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
 This project analyzes admission chances using academic metrics like GRE and TOEFL scores. It preprocesses the data, visualizes patterns through EDA, and builds linear regression models. Performance is evaluated using metrics like RÂ² and RMSE, highlighting key features affecting predictions.


**Requirements:** Python 3.12

**Note:** This project was developed using Spyder(6.0.1) from the Anaconda Navigator, which comes with many of these libraries pre-installed. If you're also using Spyder within Anaconda, you may already have most of these packages.

**Important:** Place the CSV file (Admission.csv) in the same folder as the Python file (AdmissionMultipleLinearRegression.py) so the script can locate it without additional configuration.
